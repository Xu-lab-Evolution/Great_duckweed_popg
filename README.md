<h1> Population Genomics of the Great Duckweed </h1>
The repository archives scripts involved in the great duckweed (<strong><em>Spirodela polyrhiza</em></strong>) population genomics project.

<h2> Prerequisites </h2>
The scripts were written mainly using bash, Perl, Python and R, and calculations were done in an x86_64 GNU/Linux cluster. Please modify the running environment accordingly.

<h2> How to start </h2>
Before running the scripts, please download the raw data and store the "data" folder in the same directory where you put the "scripts" folder, like this:


<ul>
  <li>
    <span class='tree-item'>working_folder/</span>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class='tree-item'>scripts/</span>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class='tree-item'>Fig_1/</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class='tree-item'>Fig_2/</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class='tree-item'>...</span>
          </li>
