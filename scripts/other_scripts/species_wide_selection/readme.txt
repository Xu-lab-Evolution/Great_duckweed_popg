Species-wide selection was run with RAiSD, SweeD, and LASSI. The following scripts were used:

run_RAiSD.sh (to run on a local computer, using a VCF with all chromosomes as input, and discarding regions with low sequencing depth).
The script raisd_output_2_R_readable.sh was used to convert the RAiSD output to a table readable by R.

launch_SweeD.sh (which was run on a cluster).

LASSI
